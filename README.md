On this repo i use 3300 annotated dataset from roboflow and run this code on Google colab.
I save my folder file on my Gdrive with this following structure.

/Yolo_model_train

    /train
    
        /images
        
        /labels
        
    /google_colab.yaml
    
Change the Yolo model and the epochs value accordingly .
Create the .yaml file according to the class
